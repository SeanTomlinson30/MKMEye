Magic the Gathering Image Recognition

I found this rather old project by Peter Sterm realeased on reddit and decided to pimp it a bit for my need as a tool for scanning cards to sell on MKM. The output will be somehow formated to be read in my MKMTool project which is hosted as well here, but no idea how this will finally work yet.

There is a little development using this source of some guys who build a mind storm robot to scan cards, they als have a nice and handy reference db:
